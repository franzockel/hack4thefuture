                Hackathon is a fusion of "hacking" and "marathon" and aims to
                solve technical problems in an unusual way. The approach of the
                hackathon is extremely constructive, as the participants create
                a helpful product in the shortest possible time in group work
                and under specification of a topic. This promotes not only
                teamwork, but also working under real conditions with project
                management and deadlines. They will be supported by mentors who
                will give them advice and support. The event should be informal,
                fun and encourage creative thinking.

            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                Since the teams are made up of participants from three coding
                schools in three european countries, the main language is
                English. But don't panic, with basic knowledge, patience and
                with hands and feet you can get very far in communication. And
                the mentors can help you translate.

                The hackathon is mainly aimed at participants and alumni of the
                coding schools Supercode, Academia de Codigo and the Social
                Hacker School. There is a limited contingent for external
                participants, if you are motivated and interested, just contact
                us.
                <br /><br />You don't need any specific previous experience, but
                you should speak some english to be able to communicate in the
                teams. No matter if you can code, design or think creatively -
                you can bring your knowledge and experience into the project
                work. You will learn everything else during the hackathon and in
                the exciting workshops.

                The actual hackathon lasts 3 days, during which you will work
                intensively on your project with your team. Beforehand, there is
                a one-hour kick-off meeting where you get to know your team and
                get important information. If you are one of the 3 winning
                teams, you will receive a grant from our sponsors and can
                continue to work on your team project. n the following 3 months,
                you should then spend at least 4 hours per week on a group
                meeting, project work or workshops.

                Yes, this is possible in consultation with your training team.
                If applicable, the hackathon can be recognized as a web project
                and thus counts as an important part of your continuing
                education. You must discuss with your employer whether you can
                participate alongside your job. For the 3 days you have to be
                completely available, the other dates can be arranged
                individually in the team.

                In short: A lot! At a hackathon you learn to focus on the
                essentials and to really push a project forward. You can put
                that to good use in your regular job. You'll also brush up on
                your soft skills as you communicate with your team. Key soft
                skills include presentation, communication, team player and
                collaboration skills. On the other hand, you will experiment
                with new tools and technologies, which will help you develop new
                technical skills. Our workshops will help you learn and build
                new skills. And on your resume, participating in an
                international hackathon will set you apart from other
                applicants.
